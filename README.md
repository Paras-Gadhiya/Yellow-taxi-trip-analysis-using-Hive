# Objective 

Analysis on dataset and more towards learning Hadoop Components.


# Used Technologies

1. Hadoop (Cloudera and Hortonworks Distribution)
2. Impala (in-memory Processing)
3. Hive (Partitioning and Bucketing)
4. HDFS



# Perform a Different kind of Analysis


1. Create a table named taxi data.
2. Load data from the CSV file into the hive table.
3. Run some basic queries to check the data is loaded properly
4. What is the total number of trips ( equal to a number of rows)?
5. What is the total revenue generated by all the trips? Fare is stored in the column total_amount.
6. What fraction of the total is paid for tolls? The toll is stored in tolls_amount.
7. What fraction of it is driver tips? The tip is stored in tip_amount.
8. What is the average trip amount?
9. For each payment type, display the following details
		i. Average fare generated – fare amount is stored in fare_amount
		ii. Average tip
		iii. Average tax – tax is stored in column mta_tax
10. On average which hour of the day generates the highest revenue?
11. What is the average distance of the trips? Distance is stored in the column trip_distance
12. How many different payment types are used? Column name – payment_type. 


> Note: we can perform more analysis on this but just make it simple for learning.
